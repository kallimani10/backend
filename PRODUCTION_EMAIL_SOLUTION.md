## 🎯 **Recommended Action:**

### **For Immediate Testing:**
Use the manual email endpoint to send the confirmation email to the user:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-server.com/api/send-manual-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "vaibhavbkalungada@gmail.com",
    "name": "Naresh Kallimani",
    "course": "Bootstrap 5 From Scratch", 
    "orderId": "order_1758871202155"
  }'
```

### **For Production:**
Set up SendGrid for reliable email delivery:

1. Sign up for SendGrid (free tier available)
2. Get API key
3. Set environment variable: `SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-key`
4. Deploy and test

## 🔍 **Why SMTP is Failing:**

Your hosting platform (Render) is blocking SMTP connections for security reasons. This is common in production environments. SendGrid and other email services work around this by using their own infrastructure.

## 📈 **Benefits of SendGrid:**

- ✅ Works on all hosting platforms
- ✅ High deliverability rates
- ✅ Professional email templates
- ✅ Email analytics and tracking
- ✅ Free tier available (100 emails/day)
- ✅ Easy setup and configuration

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1. **Immediate:** Use manual email endpoint to send confirmation
2. **Short-term:** Set up SendGrid for reliable email delivery
3. **Long-term:** Monitor email delivery and add analytics

Your payment system is working perfectly - we just need to fix the email delivery! 🎯
